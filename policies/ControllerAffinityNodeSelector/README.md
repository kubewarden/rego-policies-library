# Affinity Node Selector

This Policy allows setting a key and value for `nodeSelector` when assigning pods to nodes. 

`nodeSelector` is a field of PodSpec. It specifies a map of key-value pairs. For the pod to be eligible to scheduled on a node, the node must have each of the indicated key-value pairs as labels (it can have additional labels as well). 


When working with `nodeSelector`, the indicated key-value pair will be matched to a node label.  

```
...
  spec:
    nodeSelector:
      <key>: <value>
```
